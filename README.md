# tinyint
This repository houses the tinyinterpreter project that I am working on. A Javascript/Python-like interpreter

As this is still in development stage, the interpreter only supports a few expressions and is not turing complete yet.

Some of the expressions are:

=> StringLiterals: "Welcome to tinyint"
=> NumericLiterals: 23
=> Identifiers: @name = "Richmond Jumbo"
=> AssignmentExpressions: @Runtimes = "Javascript, Python, Java, Scheme, etc."
=> BinaryExpressions: 2 + 4
=> Comments: //

Future scope:
Enable scheme runtime interprete the parsed program
Make it more turing complete by adding iterative ability, function definitions and call stack, environment frames, native functions, networking, etc
Create a web interface where anyone can interact and execute the code in realtime
